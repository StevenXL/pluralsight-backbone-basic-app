# Backbone.js Tutorial from Pluralsight.com
This is a **partial** repository of [Pluralsight's Backbone.js
Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/backbone-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
course.

It is a partial repository because I will not be uploading the rest of the
course as I progress through it. I do not want to get in trouble do to copyright
violations.

The reason why I have uploaded this site regardless is that it is a **basic**
backbone application that shows what the library can do. This repository does
not use proper MVC compartmentalization because I wanted to avoid the added
complexity of having to link everything together. It is simply a reference of
how the different pieces talk to each other in one file.
